## Scaling Considerations

### Performance Targets
| Metric | Current | Target | Strategy |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| Response Time (p95) | 2000ms | 1500ms | Caching + Model optimization |
| Bundle Size | ~800KB | <500KB | Code splitting + optimization |
| Uptime | 99% | 99.9% | Redundancy + monitoring |
| Conversion Rate | N/A | 15% | UX optimization + A/B testing |

### Infrastructure Scaling
```typescript
// Auto-scaling configuration
const scalingConfig = {
  minInstances: 2,
  maxInstances: 50,
  targetCPU: 70,
  targetMemory: 80,
  scaleUpCooldown: '2m',
  scaleDownCooldown: '5m'
};

// Load balancing strategy
const loadBalancer = {
  algorithm: 'round_robin',
  healthCheck: '/api/health',
  timeout: '30s',
  retries: 3
};
```

### Cost Optimization
```typescript
// Cost monitoring and alerting
const costTargets = {
  llmCosts: '$100/month',
  infrastructureCosts: '$200/month',
  totalBudget: '$500/month',
  alertThreshold: 80 // percent of budget
};
```
